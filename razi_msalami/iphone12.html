    The iPhone 12 and 12 Mini is the first major redesign since the iPhone X. It
    features a chassis with flat edges, similar to the iPhone 4 and iPhone 5
    designs, as well as the iPad Pro since 2018 and the 4th-generation iPad Air,
    which also released in 2020. The notch size is similar to previous iPhone
    models, despite speculation about a reduction in width.[20] The borders
    around the display are thinner by 35% than any previous model. The new
    design also comes with a ceramic-hardened front glass, marketed as Ceramic
    Shield, while the back retains the previous generation Dual-Ion Exchange
    strengthened glass.[21] On April 20, 2021 at Apple's Special Event “Spring
    Loaded”, Apple revealed a new purple color option which became available on
    April 30.[22]
