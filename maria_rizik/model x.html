    <p>
      The Tesla Model X is a battery electric mid-size luxury crossover produced
      by Tesla, Inc. since 2015. <br />
      Developed from the full-sized sedan platform of the Tesla Model S, the
      vehicle is notable in that it uses falcon-wing doors for passenger access.
      <br />

      The Model X has an EPA size class as an SUV, and shares around 30 percent
      of its content with the Model S, half of the originally planned 60
      percent, and weighs about 10 percent more. <br />
      Both the Model X and Model S are produced at the Tesla Factory in Fremont,
      California. <br />
      The prototype was unveiled at Tesla's design studios in Hawthorne,
      California on February 9, 2012. <br />
      First deliveries of the Model X began in September 2015. <br />
      After one full year on the market, in 2016, the Model X ranked seventh
      among the world's best-selling plug-in cars. <br />
