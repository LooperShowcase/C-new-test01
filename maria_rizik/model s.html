      The Tesla Model S is a battery-powered liftback car serving as the
      flagship model of Tesla,<br />
      Inc.. The Model S features a dual-motor, all-wheel drive layout, although
      earlier versions of the Model S featured a rear-motor and rear-wheel drive
      <br />

      Development of the Model S began prior to 2007, under the codename
      "WhiteStar". <br />
      The Model S was officially announced on June 30, 2008, and a prototype
      vehicle was unveiled in March 2009. <br />
      The Model S debuted on June 22, 2012. A revised, dual-motor,
      all-wheel-drive version, known as the 60D, debuted on October 9, 2014.
      <br />
      The 60D was followed by the 70D, which made dual-motor and all-wheel drive
      the standard, followed by the 85D, P85D, and P90D. In February 2017, the
      Tesla Model S was updated with the P100D, which included a revised motor
      and was the first electric vehicle to have an EPA estimated range
      exceeding 300 miles (483 km). <br />
      A refresh of the Tesla Model S, codenamed "Palladium", was introduced in
      June 2021, offering a new "Plaid" performance model, along with a revised
      interior, powertrain, and suspension. <br />
