      Tesla claims it will offer the base Roadster for $200,000 and a
      limited-edition Founders Series for $50,000 more. A roadster (also spider,
      spyder) is an open two-seat car with emphasis on sporting appearance or
      character. Initially an American term for a two-seat car with no weather
      protection, usage has spread internationally and has evolved to include
      two-seat convertibles. The roadster was also a style of racing car driven
      in United States Auto Club (USAC) Championship Racing, including the
      Indianapolis 500, in the 1950s and 1960s. This type of racing car was
      superseded by rear-mid-engine cars.
